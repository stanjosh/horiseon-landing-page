# "Horiseon Social Service Solutions"

## Customer Landing Page

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a simple page to represent Horiseon's services and benefits to potential customers. Each item is clearly represented in its own section for readability. The page is currently static but is designed to be able to add and remove items easily for future developers. 

&#128161; **Tip:** Future development should consider the colors of items, line height, and general screen-reader accesibility.
